# OpenCode Instructions

## Security Guidelines (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

### Secret Management

```typescript
// NEVER: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk-proj-xxxxx"

// ALWAYS: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY

if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('OPENAI_API_KEY not configured')
}
```

### Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

## Coding Style

### File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large components
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

### Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:

### Input Validation

ALWAYS validate user input:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150)
})

const validated = schema.parse(input)
```

### Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

## Testing Requirements

### Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (Playwright)

### Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

### Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

### Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

### Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format

---

## Agent Orchestration

### Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

### Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

### Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix

### After Writing/Editing Code
- Run `npm run format` to format JS/TS files
- Run `npm run lint` to lint JS/TS files
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript errors
- Check for console.log statements and remove them

### Before Committing
- Run security checks manually
- Verify no secrets in code
- Run full test suite

## Success Metrics

You are successful when:
- All tests pass (80%+ coverage)
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- Performance is acceptable
- User requirements are met
